I made this project simple and fast with as less code as possible using python and three libraries for most of the work.

you can use python syntax for writting the functionns.
>>  '+' 	Addition 	x + y  
            	
>>  '-' 	Subtraction 	x - y 
 
>>  '*' 	Multiplication 	x * y  

>>  '/' 	Division 	x / y 	
  
>>  '%' 	Modulus 	x % y 	  

>>  '**' 	Exponentiation 	x ** y 	
 
>>  '//' 	Floor division 	x // y 	  

you can enter any kind of function as long as it has only one unknown.
